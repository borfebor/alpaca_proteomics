### Requirements

Required packages for a proper function of the pipeline:

- pandas 1.3.4
- numpy 1.20.3
- bokeh 2.4.2
- matplotlib.pyplot
- sklearn 1.0.1
- seaborn 0.11.2

**Other packages**
- math / pi
- random / seed, randint

## Input Data Requirements

- **Protein Groups** file from MaxQuant as `.csv`, `.txt` or `.xlsx`.
- **Enrichment Standards** file as `.csv`, `.txt` or `.xlsx`. It requires 3 columns for a proper execution (Accession, MW (kDa) & Mix concentration (µg/µl). See Enrichment for more details.

#### Labwork input
- **prep**: list with our enrichment addition steps using the following order [`Dilution_1`, `Added volume_1`, `Sample Volume_1`, `Dilution_2`, `Added volume_2`, `Sample Volume_2` ... `Dilution_N`, `Added volume_N`, `Sample Volume_N`] in which N stands for the total amount of different Enrichments that we have performed with our samples.
- **enrichment_type_dict**: dictionary of lists containing which experimentals conditions have been enriched in the same way during our sample preparation. `enrichment_type_dict` = {Enrichment_1 : [Control, Treatment_1], Enrichment_2 : [Treatment_2]}
- **count_dict**: dictionary in which keys stands for our counted Experimental condition and values for the number of cells / ml that has been counted. `count_dict` = {Control : 1000000, Treatment : 2000000}

#### Optional input
- **condition**: list with the experimental conditions assayed [`Condition_1`, `Condition_2`,...,`Condition_N`] with N being the total number of experimental conditions assayed. It is created by `alpaca.experimenter()`. 
- **n**: Integer with the number of experimental conditions. It is in the output of `alpaca.experimenter()`.
- **r**: Integer with the number of replicates. Returned by `alpaca.experimenter()`.
- **rep**: List of replicate names. [`Replicate_1`, `Replicate_2`,...,`Replicate_R`] with R being the total amount of replicates. It is returned by `alpaca.replicator()` and used as an argument `alpaca.condition_format()`.
